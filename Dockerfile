# CGO disabled explicitly: this builder has no C toolchain and the app has no
# cgo dependencies, so the build already behaves this way implicitly today.
# Pinning it guarantees a fully static binary (pure-Go DNS resolver, portable
# across libc flavors) even if a future base image or dependency adds gcc.
# Also required for the final stage: distroless/static has no libc at all.

# this if a deployment target ever includes pre-2015 hardware — the binary
# will hit SIGILL there instead of falling back.

# Numeric on purpose: with a name ("nonroot") Kubernetes cannot verify
# runAsNonRoot: true without an explicit runAsUser and refuses to start the pod.

# GOGC=300: let the heap triple (default is double, GOGC=100) before a GC
# cycle runs. Fewer/larger GC cycles trade RAM for CPU, which pays off here
# because pods are CPU-bound (GOMAXPROCS auto-tracks limits.cpu via cgroup
# quota since Go 1.25) while memory has headroom between requests.memory and
# limits.memory.

# to stay under it — turning a would-be abrupt OOMKill into graceful, bounded
# GC pressure instead. This is what makes GOGC=300 safe to run.
